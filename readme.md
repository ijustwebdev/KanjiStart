So basically I wanted to make something similar to kanjiday and I wanted to use react to do it. I think I got kind of close. Would have been nice to have a design to go off of. Not only would the end product look better but it would have saved me a bunch of time with the CSS and the couple of redesigns I did while constructing it. I wound up doing a mix of css and framer-motion animations but in the future I think I'll pick an animation library from the get-go instead so I don't have to refactor so many small pieces of code.
